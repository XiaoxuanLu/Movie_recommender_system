## Abstract
A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?

## Research questions
Build a Content-based movie recommender system

## Dataset
For this project, we used [The Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) on Kaggle. The dataset includes Metadata on over 45,000 movies and 26 million ratings from over 270,000 users.

## A tentative list of milestones for the project

- [ ] Getting the dataset
- [ ] Data Cleaning and Processing
    * Keywords, missing values, number of films per year, genres
        * plot some fancy graphs pf genres, years, keywords....
- [ ] Training the Recommender System
    * Calculating the Weighted Rating (using the IMDB formula)
    * Simple recommendations based on selected genre
        * offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie rating of the genre
    * Content-based recommendations (based on similarity of genres and keywords)
        * maybe cosine similarity or other similarity ways to find most related 10 movies
- [ ] Testing and Validation
- [ ] Saving the Trained Model for Deployment
- [ ] Writing the report
- [ ] Creating a Website and deploying the model if time allowed
- [ ] Deploying the website on cloud if time allowed

## Documentation
This can be added as the project unfolds. You should describe, in particular, what your repo contains and how to reproduce your results.
